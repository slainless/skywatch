# Skywatch

A fullstack weather app side-project.

## Motivation

Recently, I'm trying to gain in-depth knowledge in the area I'm lacking.
Some of those are: 
  - Microservices
  - Software architecure
  - Cloud infrastructure and IaC
  - Monorepo setup

I also need to vent most of my frustration in my lack of artistic sense in developing
frontend app by doing a project which consist of roughly 70% server-side codes.

## Tech stack

### Composition

The project depends on:
  - Redis
  - MongoDB
  - Turborepo
  - RabbitMQ
  - Docker
  - Bun

With some planned optional addition:
  - Terraform
  - Kubernetes

### Platform

I'm using Bun for the server platform and test runner. I don't know whether the frontend
part can also be ran on top of Bun but we will see.
